# Modeling the Environment and the Robots

We will be using the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator for setting up the virtual warehouse environment. A good starting point to familizarize with the software is to go through the [tutorials](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials) and check how build robots and environments. You don't have to follow all the steps and build the example robot. We recommend that you just read them first to get an overview and then directly start building your own models. The warehouse robots from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYjc9h8oSsY) are relatively easy to model and it is adviseable to start from an existing robot such as the Robotino model available [here](https://github.com/robocup-logistics/gazebo-rcll/tree/master/models/robotino3). You could for example use the meshes of a freely available [CAD model](https://grabcad.com/library/transport-robot-1) that looks similar to the Kiva robots from the video. We will discuss and refine your initial proposal after the kick-off presentations.
